Template submission formats for participating in Topcoder Marathon Matches.
Information in the challenge specification always overrides information in this document.

See `/data-plus-code-style` if your contest requires data submissions during the online submission phase and code during final testing.
See `/code-only-style` if you need to submit code already in the provisional testing phase.
